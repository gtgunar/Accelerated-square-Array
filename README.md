# Accelerated-square-Array
Sequential data structure

A new data structure, aimed to have a constant access time, and sqrt(n) insert/delete time*, where n is the number of contained elements.
It works by instead of storing a single vector of elements, it stores a vector of vector*-s.
The "upper" vector (which stores the addresses) approximately contains sqrt(n) amount of elements, and the lower vectors also have
Approximately sqrt(n) elements. This makes sqrt(n) insertion and deletion times possible, by only needing to insert into the middle
of sqrt(n) long vectors, or carry changes trough.

a,b,c,d are vectors stored by address in the upper vector, with their respective content below them, from bottom up

order of growth:

a b c d

7 8 9 _

3 4 6 11

1 2 5 10 

order of data:

a b c d

3 6 9 _

2 5 8 11

1 4 7 10

Balancing:
since elements are considered to be in the order of the containing vectors, and then, in the order within those vectors,
One can pop off an element from the end of a vector, and push it onto the beginning of the next in line**, without changing the order.
Likewise, the same can be done by popping at the front, and then pushing to the end of the one earlier element within the upper array.
By doing this if necessary, any arbitrary insertion can be followed by shifting the extra element, to the proper place for insertion
without changing order.

preffered shape:
The preffered shape is a square that grows first to a new array to the right, then increments every member in order***. When , the new array
is, at last incremented, a new square shape is reached. 
Assuming an x long, x tall square, it takes x new elements for the next vector to reache the height of the other vectors, and then, 
it takes x+1 elements, to increment each of the member vectors. 
Therefore, x is the integer part of the square root of n.

Insertion:
insertion happens by finding the vector where the insertion index belongs, then inserting there, to the correct place, 
and then doing a balancing as necesseary.
Since the number of blocks, and the amount of them being incremented is only dependent on n, 
one can easily find the correct insertion point:
  division of index by x, if the loading is happening at the x+1-th vector(it is the case if n-x*x<x).
  in other case: division by x+1. If the correct block is less than the increment count, then the division gives the correct block.
  if it is bigger, the incremented part's total population should be subtracted from the index,
  and the rest should be divided by x, then the incrementcount added to it.
  by instead of divisions, using modulo, one can get the place within the correct vector as well.

Deletion:
happens in a similar manner as insertion, but looks for the place of balance, at a 1 earlier position.
Access:
Correct place is calculated like in insertion, but no balancing is needed, not even on writing.

notes:
  -Since many intermediate calculation only depends on n, 
  one can easily cache them, and even check if they need updating at all.
  -since serial access means accessing a member vector serially, it has an almost equal cache coherence compared to a regular vector.
  -insertion at the end is either constant time, or sqrt(n)/2 on average( both cases have 50% chance).

*The same concept can be taken further, by using more, C amount of indirection, 
to have constant C access time and C-th root of N delete/insert time.
**Assuming proper memory management, just in time creation of new members or some other means of handling the special case of balancing
to beyond the last element.
